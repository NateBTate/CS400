Born to a poor family on the outskirts of the city, Levi was raised on scraps and a life of thievery.

Since a young age, he'd do whatever it took to survive in this world, no matter how unsavory it seemed to the wealthier public.

Almost exclusively, Levi stole from the rich, and opposed the imperial guard who made life difficult for the people in the slums.

Levi was tired of being passive and waiting for the guard to make their moves, he commited himself to stop them from ever coming back to torment the people around him.

Levi begins his trek further into the city, his goal is to destroy the outposts that supply the guard.
