Born to a poor family on the outskirts of the city, Levi was raised on scraps and a life of thievery.

Since a young age, he'd do whatever it took to survive in this world, no matter how unsavory it seemed to the wealthier public.

Almost exclusively, Levi stole from the rich, and opposed the imperial guard who made life difficult for the people in the slums.

Levi was tired of being passive and waiting for the guard to make their moves, he commited himself to stop them from ever coming back to torment the people around him.

Levi begins his trek further into the city, his goal is to destroy the outposts that supply the guard.

Stephen's paragraph:
He worked out his plans to the smallest of details, ensuring that nothing could prevent him from succeeding his task. On a hidden cloth behind his jacket, mapped out a route

to every outpost in the city. A the dawn of midnight, Levi struck the first of the outposts. With percise stealth and movements, he took out guard by guard, post by post. To

Levi's suprise, each post increased in defense. There were more soldiers, more armor, and artilliary. Levi had calculated this within his plans, but nothing to this degree. His

previous attacks much have been caught some how and alerted the main post. The only post left, as the moonlight fell and the sunlight began to rise. Given the unplanned

circumstances, Levi waited. He analyzed the post that was no longer following the same defense patters and rotations. He leaped from building to building to gain a greater 

surveillance. Until, an arrow pierced through the air, and struck Levi in the arm. He had been discovered.
